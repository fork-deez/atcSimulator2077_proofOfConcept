Abstract:
Airline detection application, uses dataset given by a external (hypothetical) radar that detects aircraft 
within a certain range/airspace. Aircraft also have digital transponders that display a given 
squawk code (yes they're really called squawk codes), and certain regions will have different assigned squawk code definitions.

Aircraft objects can be created (according to dataset) so that aircraft metadata can be more readily accessed, 
at which point user will input parameter to sort to by. An array of . Different algorithms can be used to sort radar dataset, 
as well as searching through different databases for valid squawk codes/displaying squawk code.

[ok as im wrapping this up, ive realized this could be a game, something to the likes of "Papers Please", 
but with the player as an ATC operator instead of a border officer, might work on that.]
